# VF interface vendor_id
#VENDOR_ID="0x8086"

# VF interface model_id
#MODEL_ID="0x10ed"

# template for VF interface name
# expandable variables
# _PFNAME_ - (string) name of the physical interface
# _VFID_ - (number) VF id
#VFNAME_TEMPLATE="_PFNAME__vf_VFID_"

# Comma or space separated list of PCI slots where to bring up VF interfaces
#PCI_SLOT_LIST="0000:04:00.0,0000:04:00.1"

# Comma or space separated list.
# For each PCI_SLOT of PCI_SLOT_LIST set the number of interfaces to bring up
# Example:
#PCI_NUMVFS_LIST="1,1"

# optional set VLAN for each VF interface
# The interface namig convension is like this
# Format: <parentInterface>_vf<vfid>_VLAN=<VLAN_ID>
# Example:
#eth0_vf0_VLAN=16

# optional set MTU for each VF interface
# The interface namig convension is like this
# Format: <parentInterface>_vf<vfid>_MTU=<mtu>
# Example:
#eth0_vf0_MTU=9000

# optional turn off spoof check on the VF interfaces
# Default is 'on', to turn off:
#eth0_vf0_SPOOFCHK='off'

#
# Some CentOS kernels has issue with setting the MTU on the VFs before parent
# interface is up with proper MTU. To solve this uncomment the following to
# set the parent interface before setting the MTU on the slaves
#
#SET_PARENT_MTU=yes

#
# Sometimes there is an race condition and the udev helper is trying to write
# to the sysfs before it is populated. To solve this and 1 second delay is set
# for values slee sleep(1) manpage. To disable the delay define empty variable.
#
#NUMVFS_DELAY_WRITE=1

#
# To enable verbose/debug/ logging to syslog uncomment the following
#
#DEBUG=1
